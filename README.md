# Betty
A rhythm generator for the **Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1** featuring 3 voice polyphony using a bank of 12 samples.  

## Usage
Rhythms / patterns each contains 16 steps and are triggered (advanced) by pressing any note. Just use the arpeggiator to enable instant playback!

**A + B** encoders are used to control the amount of ducking (triggered by the kick) and tuning.
Accessing the **oscillator parameters**, a pattern (1-16, 17 empty) can be selected for each of the sample groups (**A/B/C**). Random pattern allocation is achieved by changing the **rnd** parameter.
